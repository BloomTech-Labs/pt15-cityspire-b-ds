# Modeling

The Prophet model from  the FBProphet library was used to generate the predictions. The FBProphet library is not Pip friendly which means you can't use it unless you have the packages installed some other way. One option you can do is to Conda install the packages. If you are able to have the proper packages installed within this repository; the pickled rent_model.pkl should be usable.
